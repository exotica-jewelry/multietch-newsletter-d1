We want you to be successful with Multi-Etch in whatever ways you are using it, so we've tested it extensively on a variety of metals, both reactive and nonreactive, for purposes including anodizing, cleaning, welding prep and more. We've tested heated as well as room temperature Multi-Etch.

If your procedures are working for you, there's no need to change anything.

We did find that room-temperature, double strength Multi-Etch, after having been activated by heating it one time, etches more quickly than we thought. When prepping for anodization or welding, we recommend starting at two minutes instead of ten.

These also include information for using Multi-Etch as a cleaner or to remove debris from some metals, and to remove anodized colors on reactive metals.

You can see the results of testing grade 4 titanium strips for anodizing and welding prep in room-temperature Multi-Etch in this image:

We etched for varying amounts of time, from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Youâ€™ll notice that the high voltage pinks look great!

We hope this information is helpful to you. Keep on etching!

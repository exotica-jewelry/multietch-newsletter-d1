Dear $[FNAME|Multi-Etch User|Multi-Etch User]$,

It's back to school time!

This photo --

-- shows Chris Boothe explaining to middle school students the basics of titanium anodizing. Each participant could try their hand anodizing a strip of titanium, which they got to keep.

This was at the 2018 International Titanium Association <https://titanium.org> convention in Las Vegas, NV. Watch a video showing an overview of the Kids in Titanium program:

The ITA has been hosting Kids in Titanium annually for several years. This year's convention will be virtual; next year is planned for Orlando, FL. Learn more about the International Titanium Association conference:

Each convention has demonstrators showing different features of titanium. Along with anodizing, demonstrations have included information about how titanium is made into a usable form, characteristics that make titanium unique, industries using titanium, and unusual things made of titanium: a violin, a drum set, gongs, and more.

We wholeheartedly endorse ITA and their support of STEM educational programs!

The Multi-Etch you just purchased is good for at least a year. We’ve determined Multi-Etch in solution gets a little stronger, and works a little faster, the older it is. We’ve tested Multi-Etch in solution up to 15 months and it works great. Unmixed powder is good for at least eleven years.

Heated Multi-Etch usually works fastest, but room-temperature Multi-Etch can work too! We’ve written a step-by-step guide to using Multi-Etch at room temperature to help you along:

The equal-opportunity etchant: We developed Multi-Etch especially for titanium, but it works on a list of 23 types of metals, and growing! See them all:

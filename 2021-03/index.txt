NEW DISCOVERIES WITH MULTI-ETCH

Over the last year we've spent time experimenting with Multi-Etch. Some of our discoveries:

♦  We tested room-temperature Multi-Etch and discovered that it works much better if you heat the batch one time to 130-140°F -- this activates it. You can then use it right away or at some later time at room temperature (70°F). Here are some examples of titanium strips etched with room-temperature Multi-Etch at lengths of time from 30 seconds to 5 minutes:

♦  We discovered that Multi-Etch in solution gets a little stronger and works faster the older it is. When capped, it's good for at least a year.

MORE WAYS TO USE MULTI-ETCH

This month we performed experiments using room temperature Multi-Etch on rust stains inside of a porcelain toilet tank. Results were quick!
